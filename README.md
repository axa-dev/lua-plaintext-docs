# Plaintext documentation for Lua

This repository provides the official Lua Reference Manual
in plaintext format (markdown).

As convenience, it provides also a simple script named
`manlua` that can be linked (need to be linked not copied!)
in one of directories of your `$PATH`. Then just run

    manlua 5.4

Or choose other Lua version and read in your terminal.
